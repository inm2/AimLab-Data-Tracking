# AimLab-Data-Tracking
This repository is dedicated towards using time-series analysis to track progress in the FPS training-tool, AimLab. 

In first-person shooters (FPS), such as Halo, Call of Duty, or Counterstrike, the ability to take out your opponent is critical towards winning. This requires a user to be efficient at aiming. While aiming is simple to explain - just point your cursor at your opponent and click - the mechanics behind aiming can be broken down into smaller-components. [AimLab](https://aimlab.gg/), developed by Statespace Studios, aims to help players train their skills on a mechancial level.

Starting in December 2020, I have used AimLab for nearly 30 minutes each day to see what my improvements could look like over 30 days. At the time of writing this introduction, I have played for 20 days. To give a sense of what my improvement has looked like, AimLab gives a rating of 0 - 100 for each of the six training categories. The higher the rating, the better. Here are my ratings from when I first started to Day 20.

Flicking: 28 -> 40 (+12)
Tracking: 21 -> 40 (+19)
Speed: 34 -> 46 (+12)
Precision: 38 -> 45 (+7)
Perception: 83 -> 87 (+4)
Cognition: 30 -> 48 (+18)
Overall: 234 -> 306 (+72)

Despite my limited training, my skillset seems to improve. I want to understand if I can show my rate of improvement on a more quantifiable level, and predict what future improvements could look like at my current progression. Luckily, AimLab makes your personal training data available. Over the next days, I will work to publish my time-series training data to visualize and predict my future progress. 

## Links to Projects
Each of the following project links will be dedicated towards each of the training categories in AimLab. I will attempt different time-series analysis to understand and forecast the data to see what my future improvements will look like.
1. Flicking  
2. Speed   
3. Precision   
4. Tracking  
5. Cognition  
6. Detection

# AimLab-Data-Tracking
This repository is dedicated towards using time-series analysis to track progress in the FPS training-tool, AimLab. 

In first-person shooters (FPS), such as Halo, Call of Duty, or Counterstrike, the ability to take out your opponent is critical towards winning. This requires a user to be efficient at aiming. While aiming is simple to explain - just point your cursor at your opponent and click - the mechanics behind aiming can be broken down into smaller-components. [AimLab](https://aimlab.gg/), developed by Statespace Studios, aims to help players train their skills on a mechancial level.

Starting in December 2020, I have used AimLab for nearly 30 minutes each day to see what my improvements could look like over 30 days. At the time of writing this introduction, I have played for 20 days. I have noticed my averages in each of the six categories (Flicking, Speed, Precision, Cognition, Perception, Tracking), each one dedicated towards reflecting a particular skillset, improve.

Despite my limited training, my skillset seems to improve. I want to understand if I can show my rate of improvement on a more quantifiable level, and predict what future improvements could look like at my current progression. Luckily, AimLab makes your personal training data available. For this project, I have taken data from the Speed category and have conducted an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model to analyze the data I have and to forecast potential outcomes.

My main three goals of this project is to: 
1. Conduct a speed time-series score analysis using ARIMA,  
2. Future forecasting to predict outcomes,  
3. Correlation between factors that make up scoring.
